  \label{fig:case_study_overview} \end{figure}

In this section, we detail the programming of a home automation case study with
JIoT. We remark that the techniques presented in this case study are not
specific to home automation and can be used in any setting where heterogeneous
IoT technology stacks need interact. The use case is peculiar as new edge
devices can be included in the system at runtime. The source code of the system
is released under the GPL v.3 license and available at~\cite{jiot}. We report
in \cref{fig:case_study_overview} a schematic overview of the case study, where
Cloud nodes and mid-tier controllers (represented by the element labeled ``JIoT
Orchestration'' in \cref{fig:case_study_overview}) are programmed in JIoT and
orchestrate the behavior of a number of heterogeneous edge devices (whose
low-level programming is omitted here):

\begin{itemize} 

\item \emph{Philips Hue Hub}: a hub to control the Philips Hue smart home
devices;

\item \emph{Philips Hue White Lamps}: connected to the hub above; \item
\emph{Samsung SmartThings Hub}: a hub to control devices following  the
SmartThings specification~\cite{60};

\item \emph{Samsung SmartThings Motion Sensor}: connected to the hub above and
used as a presence sensor;

\item \emph{Arduino Uno}: a general-purpose microcontroller;

\item \emph{Adafruit GA1A12S202 Analog Light Sensor}: connected to the Arduino
above;

\item \emph{Adafruit DHT22 Temperature Sensor}: also connected to the Arduino
above;

\item \emph{ESP8266}: a microcontroller to manage a pre-existing  thermostat.

\end{itemize}

The case study combines commercial solutions --- e.g., the Philips Hue Hub and
the Hue White Lamps system where the Lamps are controlled by the Hub --- with
custom ones --- these span from sensors directly connected to a board, as it
happens for the Adafruit DHT22 temperature sensor, to solutions that integrate
a pre-existing hardware, like the ESP8266 that manages a pre-existing
thermostat. As illustrated in \cref{fig:case_study_overview}, this
heterogeneity of devices provides for a comprehensive scenario where we need
JIoT programs that use different application and transport protocols. In
particular, Philips and Samsung Hubs communicate with the orchestrator over
HTTP/TCP, the Arduino over MQTT/TCP, and the ESP8266 over CoAP/UDP.

In the use case we build a simple logic providing two functionalities: lighting
and temperature system control. The lighting system turns on the lights when
the motion sensor detects someone at home and the outdoor luminosity is below
some threshold. The temperature control checks the temperature and turns on the
heating system when the temperature is below some threshold. The threshold has
different values depending on whether someone is at home or not.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Structure of the Orchestration}

We now describe the structure of the orchestration in the case study, which is
illustrated in~\cref{fig:case_study_abstraction}.
%
The orchestration is composed of multiple JIoT programs. From top to bottom of
\cref{fig:case_study_abstraction}, the \texttt{LogicEngine} contains the general
logic of system control (i.e., the one that collects the data from sensors and
coordinates the execution of the actuators in the system). Since the
\texttt{LogicEngine} interacts with a multitude of mid-tier devices, its
natural deployment is in the Cloud, where it is possible to scale it according
to the number of managed devices and the load of computation. At the mid-tier
level we have JIoT \texttt{Driver}s. Each \texttt{Driver} interacts with a
specific edge device and it is deployed in a mid-tier machine in the proximity
of the controlled edge device.

\subsection{Thing Descriptors}

In the case study, the \texttt{Driver}s are statically configured to manage a
single fixed device using a JSON-LD 1.1 (that stands for JSON Linkage Data)
configuration file~\cite{jsonld}. The choice of JSON-LD is not mandatory, but
it has the benefit of following the standard W3C Web of Things~\cite{w3c17}
definition of Thing Description (TD). This makes our \texttt{Driver}s already
compliant with other WoT frameworks, simplifying future integrations with
other WoT systems.

While discussing the full structure of TD is out of the scope of this
paper, we present in \cref{fig:sensor_descriptor_1,fig:sensor_descriptor_2} examples of TDs used in our
case study. In \cref{fig:sensor_descriptor_1} we report the TD
for the DHT22 temperature sensor. For each device the JSON-LD file
specifies whether it is a sensor or an actuator (key \lstinline|"type"|) and
provides a textual description (key \lstinline|"description"|) and its name
(key \lstinline|"name"|). Each TD provides a list of
properties (key \lstinline|"properties"|) that can be read. Each property is
described by the property identifier, \lstinline{"temperature"} in our
example. The property identifier has various sub-elements describing it. In
our example we use just key \lstinline{"label"} to describe the unit of
measure.

        "label": "Celsius"
      }
    }
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Adafruit DHT22 Thing Descriptor.}
  \label{fig:sensor_descriptor_1}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[tb]

    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Philips Hue White Lamp Thing Descriptor.}
  \label{fig:sensor_descriptor_2}
\end{figure}

JSON-LD configuration files for MQTT and HTTP devices are similar. Also
configuration files for sensors and actuators are similar. As an example, we
report in \cref{fig:sensor_descriptor_2} the configuration file for Philips Hue
White Lamps. There the main differences with respect to the previous TD (\cref{fig:sensor_descriptor_1}) are:
%
\begin{itemize}
  
  \item the \lstinline{"type"} is now
  {\small\color{color:comment}\texttt{"actuator"}};

  \item the key \lstinline{"actions"} replaces the key
  \lstinline{"properties"};

  \item the key \lstinline{"description"} is used also to describe the single
  action.

\end{itemize}
%
In principle a TD can describe multiple properties belonging to a group of one
or more edge devices controlled by the same \texttt{Driver}. For simplicity,
here we have one TD for each edge device and, correspondingly, one
\texttt{Driver} that controls one edge device. We also assume that each sensor
provides one property.

\subsection{System Deployment}

Deployment-wise, JIoT provides a vast choice regarding what technology stack to
use between the \texttt{LogicEngine} and the \texttt{Driver}s.
%
Moreover, since both programs are developed in JIoT, it is easy to change their
deployment, switching to the technology stack that best suites a given scenario
(e.g., HTTP, to exploit caching, or binary formats like
SODEP~\cite{MontesiGZ14}, to limit bandwidth usage). Here, we choose to use the
HTTP/TCP stack to make our system compatible with many existing third-party
solutions --- currently HTTP/TCP is supported by the majority of software
systems~\cite{richardson2008restful}. However, different technology stacks fit
different purposes. The benefit of JIoT is that programmers can re-use the same
software components adapting their deployment to the desired communication
stacks. For example, if our goal was to be natively compatible with other
JavaScript IoT frameworks, we could have used the JSON-RPC binary protocol; if
we wanted to deploy our system as part of a Service-Oriented
Architecture~\cite{Erl07}, we could have used the SOAP protocol.

While JIoT-to-JIoT deployment is flexible, the deployment towards edge devices
is defined by the technology supported by the edge device. Concretely, in our
case study each \texttt{Driver} communicates with its edge device using (one
of) the protocol(s) supported by the latter.


\subsection{Components Behavior}

When started, a \code{Driver} loads the TD configuration file of its edge
device. Then it proceeds to register itself to the \code{LogicEngine}. In the
registration, it sends the information retrieved from the TD, enriched with two
additional pieces of information: the address where the edge device can be
contacted --- i.e., the \code{Driver} location --- and the identifier of the
user to which the edge device belongs. Once registered, the \code{Driver} acts
as a forwarder between the \code{LogicEngine} and the edge device.

The \code{LogicEngine} runs on the Cloud and manages a number of sensors and
actuators. More precisely the \code{LogicEngine} has one running session for
each user (distinguished according to the user identifier), managing all her
sensors and actuators. Each session is associated with an array of devices
that can be scanned to find the location of \code{device}s with particular
properties and interact with them. As an example, we report at lines 10--26 of
\Cref{lst:logic_example_get} the procedure \code{getTemperature} of the
\code{LogicEngine}, which computes the average temperature recorded by the
sensors of one user.
%
\begin{figure}[b]

interface driverInterface {
  RequestResponse: engineRequest( request )( response )
}

outputPort Driver {

}

define getTemperature {
 sum = 0 ;
 n = 0 ;
 for ( device in devices ) {
  if( device.<@\textcolor{black}{type}@> == "sensor" &&
    is_defined( device.properties.temperature ) ) {
   Driver.location = device.driverLocation ;
   request.operationName = "getTemperature" ;
   engineRequest@Driver( request )( response ) ;
   sum = sum + response.deviceResponse ;
   n++
  }
 } ;
 if( n!=0 ) {
  temperature = sum / n
 }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Briefly, procedure \code{getTemperature}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item scans the \lstinline{devices} structure (line 13) containing all
  registered \code{Driver}s;
  \item selects those whose {\small\texttt{type}} is \code{"sensor"} and have
  a property (under the sub-structure \code{properties}) named
  \lstinline{temperature}. Note how Jolie tree-shaped variables ease the
  exploration of structured data; in this case the one sent by the
  \code{Driver}s at registration time (and read from their associated JSON-LD
  file);
  \item it dynamically sets (line 16) the location of \code{outputPort Driver}
  (lines 5-8) to contact the selected \code{Driver};
  \item it sets the request operation to \code{getTemperature} (line 17);
  \item it retrieves the temperature sensed by the edge device controlled by
  the selected \code{Driver}, invoking it through operation
  \code{engineRequest};
  \item it aggregates the sensed temperature in variable \code{sum} and keeps
  track of the number of requests in variable \code{n} (lines 19--20);
  \item it computes the mean \code{temperature} (lines 23--25).
\end{itemize}
%

\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{lstlisting}[
basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily,
label=lst:logic_example_set,
caption=\code{LogicEngine} setTemperature procedure.]
define setTemperature {
 for ( device in devices ) {
  if( device.<@\textcolor{black}{type}@> == "actuator" &&
    is_defined( device.properties.temperature ) ) {
   Driver.location = device.location ;
   request.operationName = "setTemperature" ;
   request.deviceRequest = comfortTemperature ;
   engineRequest@Driver( request )( response )
  }
 }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

The procedures that calculate the mean of the sensed external luminosity and
the one to check the presence of people at home are similar to the one in
\cref{lst:logic_example_get}, except that the searched properties are
\lstinline{light} in the first case, and \lstinline{motion} in the second.

We report in \cref{lst:logic_example_set} one of the procedures managing
the actuators, specifically the one used to set the temperature. The main
difference with respect to the logic in \cref{lst:logic_example_get} is that
procedure \code{setTemperature}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item selects the \lstinline{devices} whose {\small \texttt{type}} is
  \lstinline{"actuator"} (line 3);
  \item sets the request operation to \code{"setTemperature"} and passes the value
  in variable \code{comfortTemperature} as parameter of the request
  (lines 6-7).
\end{itemize}

Note that the operation called on the \code{Driver} is \code{engineRequest}
both in \cref{lst:logic_example_get} and \cref{lst:logic_example_set}. This
support the extension of the \code{LogicEngine} with new procedure definitions
that implement a given goal without requiring to change the interface between
the \code{LogicEngine} and the \code{Driver}s. In turn, a request with the same
\code{operationName} (e.g., \code{"setTemperature"}) triggers different
behaviors in different \code{Driver}s, as each implements the specific logic
of interaction with its associated edge device.
%

% They
% would register their devices one-by-one using a suitable security scheme
% (basic, token, api key, etc.). The selection of the security scheme can also
% be specified in the JSON-LD TD. Every time a device for a new user is
% registered, a session of the \code{LogicEngine} managing the devices owned by
% the user is spawned. Thus, new users and new devices can enter the system at
% any time.

\subsection{Cloud Deployment}

We conclude this section by describing the Cloud deployment of the
\code{LogicEngine}, which is containerized using
Docker~\cite{Merkel:2014:DLL:2600239.2600241}. The container is deployed
automatically into an Amazon Web Service cluster via the Docker Swarm
manager~\cite{Soppelsa:2017:NDC:3153103}. The \code{LogicEngine} is deployed in
the worker cluster, allowing the manager to balance the load of requests. We
report in \cref{lst:docker} the content of the Dockerfile used to deploy the \code{LogicEngine}.
%

\begin{figure}[b]

At line 1 we declare the starting image for the container, which is the
lightweight Linux Alpine distribution with OpenJDK 8 pre-installed. At lines
3--4 we install the JIoT fork interpreter and we set the environmental
variable \code{JOLIE_HOME} to point to the location of the installed interpreter. At lines 6--7 we add the source code of the
\code{LogicEngine} in the home directory of the image.
Finally, at line 8 we start the execution of the \code{LogicEngine}.
